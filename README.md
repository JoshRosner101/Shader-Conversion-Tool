# Shader Conversion Tool
 
This is a simple powershell script to convert glsl shaders from how they're written in ShaderToy to regular glsl shaders.

# How to run
Open Windows Powershell in this directory and run this command
```console
./shader-conversion-tool.ps1 test.txt test.glsl
```
This will convert the ShaderToy code in "test.txt" into glsl code that will be outputted to "test.glsl".
